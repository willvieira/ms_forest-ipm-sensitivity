  abstract = {Species range limits are thought to result from a decline in demographic performance at range edges. However, recent studies reporting contradictory patterns in species demographic performance at their edges cast doubt on our ability to predict climate change demographic impacts. To understand these inconsistent demographic responses, we need to shift the focus from geographic to climatic edges and analyse how species responses vary with climatic constraints at the edge and species' ecological strategy. Here we parameterised integral projection models with climate and competition effects for 27 tree species using forest inventory data from over 90,000 plots across Europe. Our models estimate size-dependent climatic responses and evaluate their effects on two life trajectory metrics: life span and passage time—the time to grow to a large size. Then we predicted growth, survival, life span and passage time at the hot and dry or cold and wet edges and compared them to their values at the species climatic centre to derive indices of demographic response at the edge. Using these indices, we investigated whether differences in species demographic response between hot and cold edges could be explained by their position along the climate gradient and functional traits related to their climate stress tolerance. We found that at cold and wet edges of European tree species, growth and passage time were constrained, whereas at their hot and dry edges, survival and life span were constrained. Demographic constraints at the edge were stronger for species occurring in extreme conditions, that is, in hot edges of hot-distributed species and cold edges of cold-distributed species. Species leaf nitrogen content was strongly linked to their demographic responses at the edge. In contrast, we found only weak links with wood density, leaf size and xylem vulnerability to embolism. Synthesis. Our study presents a more complicated picture than previously thought with demographic responses that differ between hot and cold edges. Predictions of climate change impacts should be refined to include edge and species characteristics.},

  abstract = {Tree species are expected to track warming climate by shifting their ranges to higher latitudes or elevations, but cur- rent evidence of latitudinal range shifts for suites of species is largely indirect. In response to global warming, off- spring of trees are predicted to have ranges extend beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite relationship at trailing edges. Large-scale forest inventory data provide an opportunity to compare present latitudes of seedlings and adult trees at their range limits. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we directly compared seedling and tree 5th and 95th percentile latitudes for 92 species in 30 longitudinal bands for 43 334 plots across the eastern United States. We further compared these latitudes with 20th century temperature and precipita- tion change and functional traits, including seed size and seed spread rate. Results suggest that 58.7{\%} of the tree spe- cies examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction, rather than expansion, at both northern and southern boundaries. Fewer species show a pattern consistent with a northward shift (20.7{\%}) and fewer still with a southward shift (16.3{\%}). Only 4.3{\%} are consistent with expansion at both range limits. When com- pared with the 20th century climate changes that have occurred at the range boundaries themselves, there is no con- sistent evidence that population spread is greatest in areas where climate has changed most; nor are patterns related to seed size or dispersal characteristics. The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less than those for adult trees may emphasize the lack of evidence for climate-mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the risks posed by climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aim Linking local population dynamics and species distributions is crucial to predicting the impacts of climate change. Although many studies focus on the mean fitness of populations, theory shows that species distributions can be shaped by demographic stochasticity or population resilience. Here, we examine how mean fitness (measured by invasion rate), demographic stochasticity and resilience (measured by the ability to recover from disturbance) constrain populations at the edges compared with the climatic centre. Location Europe: Spain, France, Germany, Finland and Sweden. Period Forest inventory data used for fitting the models cover the period from 1985 to 2013. Major taxa Dominant European tree species; angiosperms and gymnosperms. Methods We developed dynamic population models covering the entire life cycle of 25 European tree species with climatically dependent recruitment models fitted to forest inventory data. We then ran simulations using integral projection and individual-based models to test how invasion rates, risk of stochastic extinction and ability to recover from stochastic disturbances differ between the centre and edges of the climatic niches of species. Results Results varied among species, but in general, demographic constraints were stronger at warm edges and for species in harsher climates. Conversely, recovery was more limiting at cold edges. In addition, we found that for several species, constraints at the edges were attributable to demographic stochasticity and capacity for recovery rather than mean fitness. Main conclusions Our results highlight that mean fitness is not the only mechanism at play at the edges; demographic stochasticity and population capacity to recover also matter for European tree species. To understand how climate change will drive species range shifts, future studies will need to analyse the interplay between population mean growth rate and stochastic demographic processes in addition to disturbances.},

  abstract = {Tree mortality, growth, and recruitment are essential components of forest dynamics and resiliency, for which there is great concern as climate change progresses at high latitudes. Tree mortality has been observed to increase over the past decades in many regions, but the causes of this increase are not well understood, and we know even less about long-term changes in growth and recruitment rates. Using a dataset of long-term (1958-2009) observations on 1,680 permanent sample plots from undisturbed natural forests in western Canada, we found that tree demographic rates have changed markedly over the last five decades. We observed a widespread, significant increase in tree mortality, a significant decrease in tree growth, and a similar but weaker trend of decreasing recruitment. However, these changes varied widely across tree size, forest age, ecozones, and species. We found that competition was the primary factor causing the long-term changes in tree mortality, growth, and recruitment. Regional climate had a weaker yet still significant effect on tree mortality, but little effect on tree growth and recruitment. This finding suggests that internal community-level processes-more so than external climatic factors-are driving forest dynamics.},

  abstract = {Forest responses to climate change will depend on demographic impacts in the context of competition. Current models used to predict species responses, termed climate envelope models (CEMs), are controversial, because (i) calibration and prediction are based on correlations in space (CIS) between species abundance and climate, rather than responses to climate change over time (COT), and (ii) they omit competition. To determine the relative importance of COT, CIS, and competition for light, we applied a longitudinal analysis of 27 000 individual trees over 6-18 years subjected to experimental and natural variation in risk factors. Sensitivities and climate and resource tracking identify which species are vulnerable to these risk factors and in what ways. Results show that responses to COT differ from those predicted based on CIS. The most important impact is the effect of spring temperature on fecundity, rather than any input variable on growth or survival. Of secondary importance is growing season moisture. Species in the genera Pinus, Ulmus, Magnolia, and Fagus are particularly vulnerable to climate variation. However, the effect of competition on growth and mortality risk exceeds the effects of climate variation in space or time for most species. Because sensitivities to COT and competition are larger than CIS, current models miss the most important effects. By directly comparing sensitivity to climate in time and space, together with competition, the approach identifies which species are sensitive to climate change and why, including the heretofore overlooked impact on fecundity.},

Understanding the drivers of aspects of performance, such as growth, at distribution edges is thus crucial to accurately predicting responses of tree species to climate change. Here, we use a Bayesian model and sensitivity analysis to partition the effects of climate and crowding, as a metric of competition, on radial growth of three dominant conifer species along montane ecotones in the Rocky Mountains. These ecotones represent upper and lower distribution edges of two species, and span the distribution interior of the third species. Our results indicate a greater influence of climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) than crowding on radial growth. Competition importance appears to increase towards regions of more favorable growing conditions, and precise responses to crowding and climate vary across species. Overall, our results suggest that climate will likely be the most important determinant of changes in tree growth at distribution edges of these montane conifers in the future.},

  abstract = {Ongoing and predicted global change makes understanding and predicting species' range shifts an urgent scientific priority. Here, we provide a synthetic perspective on the so far poorly understood effects of interspecific interactions on range expansion rates. We present theoretical foundations for how interspecific interactions may modulate range expansion rates, consider examples from empirical studies of biological invasions and natural range expansions as well as process-based simulations, and discuss how interspecific interactions can be more broadly represented in process-based, spatiotemporally explicit range forecasts. Theory tells us that interspecific interactions affect expansion rates via alteration of local population growth rates and spatial displacement rates, but also via effects on other demographic parameters. The best empirical evidence for interspecific effects on expansion rates comes from studies of biological invasions. Notably, invasion studies indicate that competitive dominance and release from specialized enemies can enhance expansion rates. Studies of natural range expansions especially point to the potential for competition from resident species to reduce expansion rates. Overall, it is clear that interspecific interactions may have important consequences for range dynamics, but also that their effects have received too little attention to robustly generalize on their importance. We then discuss how interspecific interactions effects can be more widely incorporated in dynamic modeling of range expansions. Importantly, models must describe spatiotemporal variation in both local population dynamics and dispersal. Finally, we derive the following guidelines for when it is particularly important to explicitly represent interspecific interactions in dynamic range expansion forecasts: if most interacting species show correlated spatial or temporal trends in their effects on the target species, if the number of interacting species is low, and if the abundance of one or more strongly interacting species is not closely linked to the abundance of the target species.},

For species with slow demography and limited disper- sal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in ‘extinction debts', where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and ‘colonization credits', where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinc- tion debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion. B},

  abstract = {Hutchinson defined species' realized niche as the set of environmental conditions in which populations can persist in the presence of competitors. In terms of demography, the realized niche corresponds to the environments where the intrinsic growth rate (r) of populations is positive. Observed species occurrences should reflect the realized niche when additional processes like dispersal and local extinction lags do not have overwhelming effects. Despite the foundational nature of these ideas, quantitative assessments of the relationship between range-wide demographic performance and occurrence probability have not been made. This assessment is needed both to improve our conceptual understanding of species' niches and ranges and to develop reliable mechanistic models of species geographic distributions that incorporate demography and species interactions. The objective of this study is to analyse how demographic parameters (intrinsic growth rate r and carrying capacity K) and population density (N) relate to occurrence probability (Pocc ). We hypothesized that these relationships vary with species' competitive ability. Demographic parameters, density, and occurrence probability were estimated for 108 tree species from four temperate forest inventory surveys (Qu{\'{e}}bec, Western US, France and Switzerland). We used published information of shade tolerance as indicators of light competition strategy, assuming that high tolerance denotes high competitive capacity in stable forest environments. Interestingly, relationships between demographic parameters and occurrence probability did not vary substantially across degrees of shade tolerance and regions. Although they were influenced by the uncertainty in the estimation of the demographic parameters, we found that r was generally negatively correlated with Pocc , while N, and for most regions K, was generally positively correlated with Pocc . Thus, in temperate forest trees the regions of highest occurrence probability are those with high densities but slow intrinsic population growth rates. The uncertain relationships between demography and occurrence probability suggests caution when linking species distribution and demographic models.},

  abstract = {A long-standing theory, originating with Darwin, suggests that abiotic forces set species range limits at high latitude, high elevation, and other abiotically 'stressful' areas, while species interactions set range limits in apparently more benign regions. This theory is of considerable importance for both basic and applied ecology, and while it is often assumed to be a ubiquitous pattern, it has not been clearly defined or broadly tested. We review tests of this idea and dissect how the strength of species interactions must vary across stress gradients to generate the predicted pattern. We conclude by suggesting approaches to better test this theory, which will deepen our understanding of the forces that determine species ranges and govern responses to climate change. Both climate and species interactions set species range limits, but it is unclear when each is most important.An old hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin, suggests that abiotic factors should be key drivers of limits in abiotically stressful areas, and species interactions should dominate in abiotically benign areas.Four distinct mechanisms, ranging from per-capita effects to community-level synergies, could result in differential importance of species interactions across stress gradients.These mechanisms, operating alone or in tandem, can result in patterns consistent or inconsistent with Darwin's hypothesis, depending on the strength and direction of effects.The most robust test of this hypothesis, not to date performed in any study, is to analyze how sensitive range limit location is to changes in the strength of one or more species interactions and also to abiotic stressors.},

This assumption is central to common conservation and management tools such as habitat suitability assessment and species distribution modeling. I test this hypothesis. Methods: I use the US Forest Inventory Assessment data for the abundance of trees across eastern North America. I use the FORAST tree-ring dataset for ontogenetic growth rate (tree-ring increment), a measure of niche performance and correlated with intrinsic rate of increase, r. Important Findings: I find that across 15 species, there are significantly more negative correlations than expected by chance. This negative correlation between abundance and performance across space contradicts common assumptions but is consistent with an inclusive niche structuring of the community. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.

Asymmetric competition is known to be a dominant cause of plant mortality, but this idea has not received much attention in studies of long-lived trees. 2. We hypothesised that while tree mortality is dependent on size relative to neighbours as a result of asymmetric competition, tree mortality of shade-tolerant species varies little with size because of their physiological and morphological adaptations to shaded environments. Furthermore, we hypothesised that tree mortality is higher in more crowded stands because of higher average resource competition, in conspecific stands because of potential negative intra-specific interactions, and in older stands because of the physiological limitations and susceptibility to minor disturbances of large trees. 3. Using data from repeatedly measured permanent sampling plots that covered a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in boreal forests, we simultaneously tested, by boosted regression tree models, the effects of an individual's relative size, stand crowding, species interaction and ageing on mortality of Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana. 4. Mortality increased strongly with decreasing relative size for all study species, and the size-dependent mortality was stronger for shade-intolerant than for shade-tolerant species. With increasing stand basal area, mortality increased for Pinus banksiana, Populus tremuloides and Picea mariana but decreased for Betula papyrifera. Mortality was higher in stands with more conspecific neighbours for Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana, but was slightly lower for Pinus banksiana. Mortality also increased with stand age for all species. Furthermore, the size-dependent mortality was generally stronger in more crowded stands. 5. Synthesis. Our findings show that tree mortality over a wide range of tree sizes, stand developmental stages and stand compositions in non-equilibrium boreal forests was strongly controlled by competition, but species interactions and ageing were also important mechanisms. Furthermore, the relative importance of these mechanisms to tree mortality differed with the shade tolerance of species.},

  abstract = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

  abstract = {Abstract Species range limits are expected to be dramatically altered under future climate change and many species are predicted to shift their distribution upslope to track their suitable conditions (i.e. based on their niche). However, there might be large discrepancies between the speed of the upward shift of the climatic niche and the actual migration velocity of the species, especially in long-lived organisms such as trees. In fact, most studies did not find any significant upward shift of the distributional limits of temperate forest trees over the last decades. It therefore beckons the questions why trees are moving upslope much slower than their bioclimatic envelope and what are the implications for ecosystem functioning. Here, we compared the simulations of the upslope displacement of the bioclimatic envelope of 16 tree species inhabiting temperate mountain forests under ongoing and future climate change obtained by correlative species distribution models (SDMs) to those from a dynamic forest model accounting for dispersal, competition and demography. We then partitioned the discrepancy in upslope migration velocity between the SDMs and the dynamic forest model into different components by manipulating dispersal limitation, interspecific competition and demography. Tree species in the dynamic forest model migrated only slowly upslope in contrast to the SDMs. Most of the difference in migration velocity can directly be attributed to tree?s demography (long life cycle), followed by effects of competition and only a marginal contribution of dispersal limitation. Additionally, lower elevation species (?non-treeline?) shifted slower upslope than high elevation species (?treeline?) indicating a strong effect of inter-specific competition at their leading edge. Synthesis. Forests have a high inertia to climate change because of their longevity and ability to acclimatise to high climatic fluctuations. Lower elevation tree species (deciduous) only slowly establish in stands at higher elevation where coniferous species dominate and likely profit from facilitation by disturbance events. Therefore, forest ecosystems seem to persist, even if climate becomes unfavourable, until they approach a tipping point at which an extreme event (e.g., drought, storm or insect attack) leads to a large dieback and resource change enabling new suitable species to spread and establish.},

  abstract = {Rising global temperatures are suggested to be drivers of shifts in tree species ranges. The resulting changes in community composition may negatively impact forest ecosystem function. However, long-term shifts in tree species ranges remain poorly documented. We test for shifts in the northern range limits of 16 temperate tree species in Quebec, Canada, using forest inventory data spanning three decades, 15° of longitude and 7° of latitude. Range shifts were correlated with climate warming and dispersal traits to understand potential mechanisms underlying changes. Shifts were calculated as the change in the 95th percentile of latitudinal occurrence between two inventory periods (1970–1978, 2000–2012) and for two life stages: saplings and adults. We also examined sapling and adult range offsets within each inventory, and changes in the offset through time. Tree species ranges shifted predominantly northward, although species responses varied. As expected shifts were greater for tree saplings, 0.34 km yr−1, than for adults, 0.13 km yr−1. Range limits were generally further north for adults compared to saplings, but the difference diminished through time, consistent with patterns observed for range shifts within each life stage. This suggests caution should be exercised when interpreting geographic range offsets between life stages as evidence of range shifts in the absence of temporal data. Species latitudinal velocities were on average {\textless}50{\%} of the velocity required to equal the spatial velocity of climate change and were mostly unrelated to dispersal traits. Finally, our results add to the body of evidence suggesting tree species are mostly limited in their capacity to track climate warming, supporting concerns that warming will negatively impact the functioning of forest ecosystems.

  abstract = {Knowledge of species' geographic distributions is critical for understanding and forecasting population dynamics, responses to environmental change, biodiversity patterns, and conservation planning. While many suggestive correlative occurrence models have been used to these ends, progress lies in understanding the underlying population biology that generates patterns of range dynamics. Here, we show how to use a limited quantity of demographic data to produce demographic distribution models (DDMs) using integral projection models for size-structured populations. By modeling survival, growth, and fecundity using regression, integral projection models can interpolate across missing size data and environmental conditions to compensate for limited data. To accommodate the uncertainty associated with limited data and model assumptions, we use Bayesian models to propagate uncertainty through all stages of model development to predictions. DDMs have a number of strengths: 1) DDMs allow a mechanistic understanding of spatial occurrence patterns; 2) DDMs can predict spatial and temporal variation in local population dynamics; 3) DDMs can facilitate extrapolation under altered environmental conditions because one can evaluate the consequences for individual vital rates. To illustrate these features, we construct DDMs for an overstory perennial shrub in the Proteaceae family in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. We find that the species' population growth rate is limited most strongly by adult survival throughout the range and by individual growth in higher rainfall regions. While the models predict higher population growth rates in the core of the range under projected climates for 2050, they also suggest that the species faces a threat along arid range margins from the interaction of more frequent fire and drying climate. The results (and uncertainties) are helpful for prioritizing additional sampling of particular demographic parameters along these gradients to iteratively refine projections. In the appendices, we provide fully functional R code to perform all analyses.},

  abstract = {Habitat suitability estimated with probability of occurrence in species distribution models (SDMs) is used in conservation to identify geographic areas that are most likely to harbor individuals of interest. In theory, probability of occurrence is coupled with individual fitness so that individuals have higher fitness at the centre of their species environmental niche than at the edges, which we here define as 'fitness-centre' hypothesis. However, such relationship is uncertain and has been rarely tested across multiple species. Here, we quantified the relationship between coarse-scale probability of occurrence projected with SDMs and individual fitness in 66 tree species native of North America. We used 1) field data of individuals' growth rate (height and diameter standardized by age) available from the United States Forest Inventory Analysis plots; and 2) common garden data collected from 23 studies reporting individual growth rate, survival, height and diameter of individuals originated from different provenances in United States and Canada. We show 'fitness-centre' relationships are rare, with only 12{\%} and 11{\%} of cases showing a significant positive correlation for field and common garden data, respectively. Furthermore, we found the 'fitness-centre' relationship is not affected by the precision of the SDMs and it does not depend upon dispersal ability and climatic breath of the species. Thus, although the 'fitness-centre' relationship is supported by theory, it does not hold true in nearly any species. Because individual fitness plays a relevant role in buffering local extinction and range contraction following climatic changes and biotic invasions, our results encourage conservationists not to assume the 'fitness-centre' relationship when modelling species distribution.},

We found that the performance of 93 populations of 34 plant species worldwide – as measured by in situ population growth rate, its temporal variation and extinction risk – was not correlated with climate suitability. However, correlations of demographic processes underpinning population performance with climate suitability indicated both resistance and vulnerability pathways of population responses to climate: in less suitable climates, plants experienced greater retrogression (resistance pathway) and greater variability in some demographic rates (vulnerability pathway). While a range of demographic strategies occur within species' climatic niches, demographic strategies are more constrained in climates predicted to be less suitable.},

@Article{Guisan2000,
  abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Aim  The study and prediction of species–environment relationships is currently mainly based on species distribution models. These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation  We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions  Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change. It thereby strengthens links between biogeography, population biology and theoretical and applied ecology.},

  abstract = {Aim: Dynamic range models are proposed to investigate species distributions and to project range shifts under climate change. They are based upon the Hutchinsonian niche theory, specifying that the occurrence of a species in an environmental space should be limited to positions where the intrinsic growth rate is positive. Evaluating population growth rate is, however, difficult for physiologically structured populations, such as forest stands, owing to size-induced individual variation in performance. Therefore, we still have a limited understanding of which aspect of tree demography contributes the most to their geographical range limit. We develop an index of demographic performance for size-structured populations and study its variation across a climatic gradient. We then investigate the relationship between the demographic performance index and species distribution. Location: North America (57–124° W, 26–52° N). Time period: 1963–2010. Major taxa studied: Fourteen tree species. Methods: We represent forest dynamics with a size-structured population model and neighbourhood competition with the perfect plasticity approximation. We then derive the lifetime reproduction per individual, (Formula presented.), in the absence of density dependence. Using forest inventory data, we assess how tree demography for each species varies with climate. We test the model by comparing (Formula presented.) and the probability of occurrence within species ranges. Results: We find that both growth and mortality rates vary across species distributions, but climate explains little of the observed variation. Individual size and neighbourhood competition are the primary explanatory variables of tree demography. Finally, we find that (Formula presented.) relates weakly to the probability of occurrence, with no systematic decline in population growth rates towards the range limits. Main conclusions: Spatial and size-induced variation in tree growth and mortality do not explain range limits and are insufficient to enable an understanding of tree dynamics. We propose that phenomena perceived mostly at the metapopulation scale should also be considered.},

Opposing vital rate trends across environments, a phenomenon that has been loosely called 'demographic compensation', may allow species to occupy larger geographical ranges and alter their responses to climate change. Yet the term has never been precisely defined, nor has its existence or strength been assessed for multiple species. Here, we provide a rigorous definition, and use it to develop a strong test for demographic compensation. By applying the test to data from 26 published, multi-population demographic studies of plants, we show that demographic compensation commonly occurs. We also investigate the mechanisms by which this phenomenon arises by assessing which demographic processes and life stages are most often involved. In addition, we quantify the effect of demographic compensation on variation in population growth rates across environmental gradients, a potentially important determinant of the size of a species' geographical range. Finally, we discuss the implications of demographic compensation for the responses of single populations and species' ranges to temporal environmental variation and to ongoing environmental trends, e.g. due to climate change.},

In this paper, I discuss a variety of factors, in addition to competition, that influence the observed relationship between species distribution and the availability of suitable habitat. In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions},

For 482 North American tree species that occur east of the Rocky Mountains, we investigated the shape(s) of the relationship between the probability of occupancy of a given location and macroclimate, and its consistency among species and regions. Location North America. Methods Using Little's tree range maps, we tested four hypothetical shapes of response relating occupancy to climate: (1) high occupancy of all suitable climates; (2) threshold response (i.e. unsuitable climates exclude species, but within the thresholds, species presence is independent of climate); (3) occupancy is a bivariate normal function of annual temperature and precipitation; and (4) asymmetric limitation (i.e. abiotic factors set abrupt range limits in stressful climates only). Finally, we compared observed climatic niches with the occupancy of similar climates on off-shore islands as well as west of the Rockies. Results (a) Species' distributions in climatic space do not have strong thresholds, nor are they systematically skewed towards less stressful climates. (b) Occupancy can generally be described by a bivariate normal function of temperature and precipitation, with little or no interaction between the two variables. This model, averaged over all species, accounts for 82{\%} of the spatial variation in the probability of occupancy of a given area. (c) Occupied geographic ranges are typically ringed by unoccupied, but climatically suitable areas. (d) Observed climatic niche positions are largely conserved between regions. Main conclusions We conclude that, despite the complexities of species histories and biologies, to a first approximation most of the variation in their geographic distributions relates to climate, in similar ways for nearly all species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Most large-scale multispecies studies of tree growth have been conducted in tropical and cool temperate forests, whereas Mediterranean water-limited ecosystems have received much less attention. This limits our understanding of how growth of coexisting tree species varies along environmental gradients in these forests, and the implications for species interactions and community assembly under current and future climatic conditions. Here, we quantify the absolute effect and relative importance of climate, tree size and competition as determinants of tree growth patterns in Iberian forests, and explore interspecific differences in the two components of competitive ability (competitive response and effect) along climatic and size gradients. Spatially explicit neighborhood models were developed to predict tree growth for the 15 most abundant Iberian tree species using permanent-plot data from the Spanish Second and Third National Forest Inventory (IFN). Our neighborhood analyses showed a climatic and size effect on tree growth, but also revealed that competition from neighbors has a comparatively much larger impact on growth in Iberian forests. Moreover, the sensitivity to competition (i.e. competitive response) of target trees varied markedly along climatic gradients causing significant rank reversals in species performance, particularly under xeric conditions. We also found compelling evidence for strong species-specific competitive effects in these forests. Altogether, these results constitute critical new information which not only furthers our understanding of important theoretical questions about the assembly of Mediterranean forests, but will also be of help in developing new guidelines for adapting forests in this climatic boundary to global change. If we consider the climatic gradients of this study as a surrogate for future climatic conditions, then we should expect absolute growth rates to decrease and sensitivity to competition to increase in most forests of the Iberian Peninsula (in all but the northern Atlantic forests), making these management considerations even more important in the future. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Here we outline the method used to generate the spatial models, detail the array of products available and how they maybe accessed, briefly describe some of the usage and impact of the models, and discuss anticipated further developments. Our initial motivation in developing these models was to support forestry-related applications. They have since been utilized by a wider range of agencies and researchers.

  abstract = {Knowing where species occur is fundamental to many ecological and environmental applications. Species distribution models (SDMs) are typically based on correlations between species occurrence data and environmental predictors, with ecological processes captured only implicitly. However, there is a growing interest in approaches that explicitly model processes such as physiology, dispersal, demography and biotic interactions. These models are believed to offer more robust predictions, particularly when extrapolating to novel conditions. Many process–explicit approaches are now available, but it is not clear how we can best draw on this expanded modelling toolbox to address ecological problems and inform management decisions. Here, we review a range of process–explicit models to determine their strengths and limitations, as well as their current use. Focusing on four common applications of SDMs – regulatory planning, extinction risk, climate refugia and invasive species – we then explore which models best meet management needs. We identify barriers to more widespread and effective use of process-explicit models and outline how these might be overcome. As well as technical and data challenges, there is a pressing need for more thorough evaluation of model predictions to guide investment in method development and ensure the promise of these new approaches is fully realised.},

  abstract = {Abstract Selecting among competing statistical models is a core challenge in science. However, the many possible approaches and techniques for model selection, and the conflicting recommendations for their use, can be confusing. We contend that much confusion surrounding statistical model selection results from failing to first clearly specify the purpose of the analysis. We argue that there are three distinct goals for statistical modeling in ecology: data exploration, inference, and prediction. Once the modeling goal is clearly articulated, an appropriate model selection procedure is easier to identify. We review model selection approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses relative to each of the three modeling goals. We then present examples of modeling for exploration, inference, and prediction using a time series of butterfly population counts. These show how a model selection approach flows naturally from the modeling goal, leading to different models selected for different purposes, even with exactly the same data set. This review illustrates best practices for ecologists and should serve as a reminder that statistical recipes cannot substitute for critical thinking or for the use of independent data to test hypotheses and validate predictions.},

  abstract = {1. To test hypotheses concerning adaptation and acclimation of tree species to shaded habitats we determined the growth, biomass partitioning and morphology of seedlings of nine near-boreal tree species in high- and low-light greenhouse environment (25 and 5{\%} of full sunlight, respectively), comparable to sunlit gap and shaded microsites in boreal forests. The species differ widely in shade tolerance, seed size and leaf life span. 2. In low light, all species allocated proportionally more biomass to stems and less to roots, but the same to foliage, compared with the high-light environment. At a common size, all species had finer leaf morphology (higher specific leaf area, SLA) but coarser root morphology (lower specific root length, SRL) in low than high light. From a whole plant perspective, all species enhanced leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio, LAR) in low light and root length per unit plant mass (root length ratio, RLR) in high light. 3. Shade-intolerant deciduous species had higher RGR, SLA and SRL than larger seeded evergreens: ranking from Populus, Betula and Larix spp., then to five evergreen Pinus, Picea and Thuja spp., which were generally comparable in these traits. There were no changes in growth rankings of species between high- and low-light environments, nor consistent differences among species in biomass partitioning. Hence, species differences in leaf and root morphology (SLA, SRL) drove whole plant patterns, such as Populus, Betula and Larix had greater total leaf area and root length per unit plant mass (LAR and RLR, respectively) than the evergreens. Interspecific variation in RGR in both high and low light was positively correlated (r ≃ 0.9) with SLA, SRL, LAR and RLR, and negatively correlated (r ≃ -0.9) to seed mass and leaf life span. 4. These data suggest that SLA, SRL, NAR and RGR are closely associated with variation in life-history traits and that variation in leaf and root structure more strongly influences patterns of RGR among species and light environments than does biomass partitioning.},

Most conceptual forest development models do not incorporate current knowledge of the: (1) complexity of structures (including spatial patterns) and developmental processes; (2) duration of development in long-lived forests; (3) complex spatial patterns of stands that develop in later stages of seres; and particularly (4) the role of disturbances in creating structural legacies that become key elements of the post-disturbance stands. We elaborate on existing models for stand structural development using natural stand development of the Douglas-fir - western hemlock sere in the Pacific Northwest as our primary example; most of the principles are broadly applicable while some processes (e.g. role of epicormic branches) are related to specific species. We discuss the use of principles from disturbance ecology and natural stand development to create silvicultural approaches that are more aligned with natural processes. Such approaches provide for a greater abundance of standing dead and down wood and large old trees, perhaps reducing short-term commercial productivity but ultimately enhancing wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, including soil protection and nutrient retention. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Darwin hypothesised that abiotic factors generally impose species' high-latitude and high-elevation (typically cool) range limits, whereas biotic interactions more often impose species' low-latitude/low-elevation (typically warm) limits, but empirical support has been mixed. Here, we clarify three predictions arising from Darwin's hypothesis and show that previously mixed support is partially due to researchers testing different predictions. Using a comprehensive literature review (885 range limits), we find that biotic interactions, including competition, predation and parasitism, contributed to {\textgreater}60{\%} of range limits and influenced species' warm limits more often than cool limits. Abiotic factors contributed more often than biotic interactions to cool range limits, but temperature contributed frequently to both cool and warm limits. Our results suggest that most range limits will be sensitive to climate warming, but warm-limit responses in particular will depend strongly on biotic interactions.},

  abstract = {s Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexis-tence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantifica-tion shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific inter-actions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are es-sential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coex-istence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

  abstract = {Accounting for water stress-induced tree mortality in forest productivity models remains a challenge due to uncertainty in stress tolerance of tree populations. In this study, logistic regression models were developed to assess species-specific relationships between probability of mortality (Pm) and drought, drawing on 8.1 million observations of change in vital status (m) of individual trees across North America. Drought was defined by standardized (relative) values of soil water content (Ws,z) and reference evapotranspiration (ETr,z) at each field plot. The models additionally tested for interactions between the water-balance variables, aridity class of the site (AC), and estimated tree height (h). Considering drought improved model performance in 95 (80) per cent of the 64 tested species during calibration (cross-validation). On average, sensitivity to relative drought increased with site AC (i.e. aridity). Interaction between water-balance variables and estimated tree height indicated that drought sensitivity commonly decreased during early height development and increased during late height development, which may reflect expansion of the root system and decreasing whole-plant, leaf-specific hydraulic conductance, respectively. Across North America, predictions suggested that changes in the water balance caused mortality to increase from 1.1{\%} yr−1 in 1951 to 2.0{\%} yr−1 in 2014 (a net change of 0.9 ± 0.3{\%} yr−1). Interannual variation in mortality also increased, driven by increasingly severe droughts in 1988, 1998, 2006, 2007 and 2012. With strong confidence, this study indicates that water stress is a common cause of tree mortality. With weak-to-moderate confidence, this study strengthens previous claims attributing positive trends in mortality to increasing levels of water stress. This ‘learn-as-we-go' approach – defined by sampling rare drought events as they continue to intensify – will help to constrain the hydraulic limits of dominant tree species and the viability of boreal and temperate forest biomes under continued climate change.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to lead to upslope shifts in tree species distributions, but the evidence is mixed partly due to land-use effects and individualistic species responses to climate. We examined how individual tree species demography varies along elevational climatic gradients across four states in the northeastern United States to determine whether species elevational distributions and their potential upslope (or downslope) shifts were controlled by climate, land-use legacies (past logging), or soils. We characterized tree demography, microclimate, land-use legacies, and soils at 83 sites stratified by elevation ({\~{}}500 to {\~{}}1200 m above sea level) across 12 mountains containing the transition from northern hardwood to spruce-fir forests. We modeled elevational distributions of tree species saplings and adults using logistic regression to test whether sapling distributions suggest ongoing species range expansion upslope (or contraction downslope) relative to adults, and we used linear mixed models to determine the extent to which climate, land use, and soil variables explain these distributions. Tree demography varied with elevation by species, suggesting a potential upslope shift only for American beech, downslope shifts for red spruce (more so in cool regions) and sugar maple, and no change with elevation for balsam fir. While soils had relatively minor effects, climate was the dominant predictor for most species and more so for saplings than adults of red spruce, sugar maple, yellow birch, cordate birch, and striped maple. On the other hand, logging legacies were positively associated with American beech, sugar maple, and yellow birch, and negatively with red spruce and balsam fir – generally more so for adults than saplings. All species exhibited individualistic rather than synchronous demographic responses to climate and land use, and the return of red spruce to lower elevations where past logging originally benefited northern hardwood species indicates that land use may mask species range shifts caused by changing climate.},

  abstract = {Seedling recruitment and survival are critical bottlenecks in tree population dynamics and are likely to play central roles in shifts in species distributions under climate change. We use data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis program to quantify the relationships between two key climate variables— mean annual temperature and growing season water deficit—and rates of seedling recruitment and sur- vival for the 50 most common tree species in the eastern United States. Our statistical models include the positive effects of conspecific adult abundance on recruitment and the potentially negative competitive effects of total canopy abundance on seedling survival. The tradeoff between these two effects creates a range from positive to negative conspecific density dependence, depending on the absolute and relative abundance of conspecific vs. heterospecific adults in a plot. Variation along the climate gradients mirrors patterns found previously in adult distributions. The clearest signal is in variation in the presence/absence of seedlings, while seedling density when present is only weakly related to local climate. The relatively narrow niche breadths for the presence of both seedlings and adults suggest that the frequency of occur- rence of species within the landscape, rather than their relative abundance when present, will show the greatest response to climate change. Our analyses predict seedling survival as a function of mean annual temperature independent of the effects of competition and water deficit and thus provide an indication of the fundamental niche for seedling distribution along the temperature gradient. For more than half of the 50 species, their realized seedling niches are displaced to warmer climates. This reflects the prevalence of species in which survival declines with increasing temperature across a significant portion of at least their southern range. Our results show that when the effects of warmer climates are taken into account, seedling survival generally increases with increasing water deficit in the generally humid climates of the eastern United States.

  abstract = {Ecologists have limited understanding of how geographic variation in forest biomass arises from differences in growth and mortality at continental to global scales. Using forest inventories from across North America, we partitioned continental-scale variation in biomass growth and mortality rates of 49 tree species groups into (1) species-independent spatial effects and (2) inherent differences in demographic performance among species. Spatial factors that were separable from species composition explained 83{\%} and 51{\%} of the respective variation in growth and mortality. Moderate additional variation in mortality (26{\%}) was attributable to differences in species composition. Age-dependent biomass models showed that variation in forest biomass can be explained primarily by spatial gradients in growth that were unrelated to species composition. Species-dependent patterns of mortality explained additional variation in biomass, with forests supporting less biomass when dominated by species that are highly susceptible to competition (e.g. Populus spp.) or to biotic disturbances (e.g. Abies balsamea).},

We conclude that at low richness different mycorrhizal strategies may allow tree species to partition nutrient uptake and thus can increase community productivity, whereas at high richness other dimensions of functional diversity can enhance resource partitioning and community productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of mixed mycorrhizal strategies, in addition to that of taxonomic diversity in general, for maintaining ecosystem functioning in forests.},

We found that 43{\%} of species showed stable population size at both northern and southern edges. Demographic compensation was detected in 25 species, yet 15 of them still showed a potential retraction from southern edges, indicating that compensation alone cannot maintain range stability. Simulated climatic warming caused larger decreases in $\lambda$ for most species and weakened the effectiveness of demographic compensation in stabilising ranges. These findings suggest that climate stress may surpass the limited capacity of demographic compensation and pose a threat to the viability of North American tree populations.},

  abstract = {The identification of patterns in life-history strategies across the tree of life is essential to our prediction of population persistence, extinction, and diversification. Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55{\%} of the variation in plant life-history strategies is ade-quately characterized using two independent axes: the fast–slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a repro-ductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative inde-pendence of the fast–slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may comple-ment trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; to-gether these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments. life history strategy | iteroparity | generation time | matrix population model | phylogenetic signal D emographic schedules of survival, growth, and reproduction, which comprise life-history strategies, are fundamental to our understanding of a range of ecological and evolutionary processes, such as invasions and local extinctions (1–3), com-munity structure (4, 5), and species diversification (6, 7). Con-sequently, the development and careful testing of theory on how organisms allocate resources to survival, growth, and reproduction are important goals for evolutionary biology, ecology, and conser-vation biology (8). Indeed, calls for the development of a {"} periodic table {"} to classify species based on their life-history strategies and to predict population dynamics and community composition go back to the early development of evolutionary biology as a discipline (9). A main axiom of life-history theory is that trade-offs (i.e., bud-getary compromises) between different aspects of an organism's demographic schedules, such as survival, growth, and/or re-production, constrain and optimize the range of possible life-history strategies that can evolve across the tree of life (10, 11). However, the plant kingdom encompasses a vast amount of life-history variation; plant longevity, for instance, ranges from weeks to millennia (12). Many plant species' life cycles include cryptic life stages such as seedbanks (13) or dormant adults (similar to animal hibernation) (14). Reproduction also can be highly vari-able among plants, with seed mass and per-capita seed pro-duction ranging across six orders of magnitude (15). Previous classifications of plant life-history strategies have been limited in geographic (16, 17), taxonomic, and phylogenetic scales (17) and in the ability to differentiate life-history trade-offs (17–19). Here we propose an approach analogous to that developed decades ago for vertebrates (20) to study the drivers behind plant life-history variation. We combine demographic, phylogenetic, and ecological data from natural populations of 418 plant species worldwide (Fig. 1) to address the following questions: (i) What are the main axes of variation of plant life-history strategies? (ii) To what extent do phylogenetic ancestry, habitat, growth form, and size constrain plant life-history variation? We then test whether the position of a species on these axes predicts two important metrics of population performance: population growth rate and speed of recovery from disturbances. If clear patterns emerge, they may form the basis for a satisfactory classification and predictive},

  abstract = {1. Plant interactions play a central role in regulating plant communities and this role can be altered by abiotic stress. With increasing stress, ecological theory predicts that the role of competition decreases whilst that of facilitation increases. Such predictions have been tested with short-term plant removal experiments using two distinct indices evaluating the role of plant interactions: the intensity (absolute impact) and the importance (impact relative to that of other abiotic constraints) of plant interactions. 2. Using data on individual tree radial growth from more than 17 000 forest plots covering the habitat conditions of 16 species in the Alps and the Jura mountains of France, we show that non-manipulative estimates of plant interactions provide an alternative to this experimental approach. We developed a Bayesian neighbourhood growth competition model to test theoretical predictions about plant–plant interactions with a much larger spatio-temporal scope and set of study species than classically used in experimental studies of plant–plant interactions. 3. Our analyses revealed that competition – measured as neighbours effects on adult tree growth – varies in importance but not in intensity along two major bioclimatic gradients (degree-day sum and water availability). Observed patterns of competition importance differed between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species. First, the mean importance of competition was found to be much higher for shade-intolerant species. Second, for shade-intolerant species the importance of competition remained high even at low crowding indices (i.e. at a low competitor density), whereas for shade-tolerant species competition only became important at high crowding indices. {\{}4.Synthesis.{\}} Our non-manipulative approach to the study of plant–plant interactions allows analysing interactions among many species over large climatic gradients. Our results clearly demonstrate that a quantitative estimation of density dependence effects is key to understanding how plant–plant interactions vary along abiotic gradients. Growth predictions derived from our model can easily be integrated with other results on tree regeneration and mortality in individual-based models to investigate how plant–plant interactions drive tree population and community dynamics under varying climatic conditions.},

Research needs to move beyond simple experimental studies and environmental envelope projections for single species towards identifying where ecosystem change is likely to occur and the drivers for this change. For this to happen, we advocate research directions that (i) identify the critical species within the target ecosystem, and the life stage(s) most susceptible to changing conditions and (ii) the key interactions between these species and components of their broader ecosystem.

Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and varying life-history strategies related to resource partitioning are known to influence plant fitness, and thereby community composition and diversity. However, we have little understanding of how these mechanisms interact and how they vary across life stages. Here, we document the interaction between CNDD and life-history strategy, based on growth-mortality trade-offs, from seedling to adult tree for 47 species in a tropical forest. Species' life-history strategies remained consistent across stages: fast-growing species had higher mortality than slow-growing species at all stages. In contrast, mean CNDD was strongest at early life stages (i.e. seedling, sapling). Fast-growing species tended to suffer greater CNDD than slow-growing species at several, but not all life stages. Overall, our results demonstrate that coexistence mechanisms interact across multiple life stages to shape diverse tree communities. },

  abstract = {Climate and competition are often presented from two opposing views of the dominant driver of individual tree growth and species distribution in temperate forests, such as those in the eastern United States. Previous studies have provided abundant evidence indicating that both factors influence tree growth, and we argue that these effects are not independent of one another and rather that interactions between climate, competition, and size best describe tree growth. To illustrate this point, we describe the growth responses of five common eastern tree species to interacting effects of temperature, precipitation, competition, and individual size using maximum likelihood estimation. Models that explicitly include interactions among these four factors explained over half of the variance in annual growth for four out of five species using annual climate. Expanding temperature and precipitation analyses to include seasonal interactions resulted in slightly improved models with a mean R2 of 0.61 (SD 0.10). Growth responses to individual factors as well their interactions varied greatly among species. For example, growth sensitivity to temperature for Quercus rubra increased with maximum annual precipitation, but other species showed no change in sensitivity or slightly reduced annual growth. Our results also indicate that three-way interactions among individual stem size, competition, and temperature may determine which of the five co-occurring species in our study could have the highest growth rate in a given year. Continued consideration and quantification of interactions among climate, competition, and individual-based characteristics are likely to increase understanding of key biological processes such as tree growth. Greater parameterization of interactions between traditionally segregated factors such as climate and competition may also help build a framework to reconcile drivers of individual-based processes such as growth with larger-scale patterns of species distribution.},

Most species showed statistically significant boundary versus core differences in most rates at both boundary types.

  abstract = {Premise of the study: The extent to which climate controls species' range limits is a classic biological question that is particularly relevant given anthropogenic climate change. While climate is known to play a role in species distributions, biotic interactions such as competition also affect range limits. Furthermore, climatic and biotic controls of ranges may vary in strength across life stages, implying complex range shift dynamics with climate change. Methods: We quantified climatic and competitive influences on growth of juvenile and adult trees of three conifer species on Mt. Rainier, Washington, United States. We collected annual growth data of these trees, which we compared to the competitive environment and annual climate (100 years of data) experienced by each individual. Key results: We found that the relationships between growth and climate and between growth and competition differed by life stage and location. Growth was sensitive to heavy snowpack and cold temperatures at high elevation upper limits (treeline), but growth was poorly explained by climate in low elevation closed-canopy forests. Competitive effects on growth were more important for saplings than adults, but did not become more important at either upper or lower range limits. Conclusions: In all, our results suggest that range shifts under climate change will differ at leading vs. trailing edges. At treeline, warmer temperatures will lead to increased growth and likely to range expansion. However, climate change will have less dramatic effects in low elevation closed-canopy forest communities, where growth is less strongly limited by climate, especially at young life stages. {\textcopyright} 2013 Botanical Society of America.},

Using bayesian analysis of over 430,000 tree records from a large eastern US forest database we characterised tree mortality as a function of climate, soils, species and size (stem diameter). We found (1) mortality is U-shaped vs. stem diameter for all 21 species examined; (2) mortality is hump-shaped vs. plot basal area for most species; (3) geographical variation in mortality is substantial, and correlated with several environmental factors; and (4) individual species vary substantially from the combined average in the nature and magnitude of their mortality responses to environmental variation. Regional variation in mortality is therefore the product of variation in species composition combined with highly varied mortality-environment correlations within species. The results imply that variation in mortality is a crucial part of variation in the forest carbon cycle, such that including this variation in models of the global carbon cycle could significantly narrow uncertainty in climate change predictions.},

  abstract = {Indirect climate effects on tree fecundity that come through variation in size and growth (climate-condition interactions) are not currently part of models used to predict future forests. Trends in species abundances predicted from meta-analyses and species distribution models will be misleading if they depend on the conditions of individuals. Here we find from a synthesis of tree species in North America that climate-condition interactions dominate responses through two pathways, i) effects of growth that depend on climate, and ii) effects of climate that depend on tree size. Because tree fecundity first increases and then declines with size, climate change that stimulates growth promotes a shift of small trees to more fecund sizes, but the opposite can be true for large sizes. Change the depresses growth also affects fecundity. We find a biogeographic divide, with these interactions reducing fecundity in the West and increasing it in the East. Continental-scale responses of these forests are thus driven largely by indirect effects, recommending management for climate change that considers multiple demographic rates.},

  abstract = {Traits affecting survival from seedling through adult stages are key elements of tree life histories, and it is widely assumed that variation in survival of adult trees plays an important role in the distribution of species along climate gradients. We use data from plots censused by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program during the years 2000-2011 to quantify relationships between two key aspects of climate-mean annual temperature and growing season water deficit-and rates of sapling and canopy tree survival for the 50 most common tree species in the eastern United States. Our analyses include consideration of the effects of tree size, competition, and nitrogen deposition to avoid confounding effects and to provide context for the importance of variation in climate relative to other factors. Tree size and competitive effects, including the effect of tree size on sensitivity to competition, had the greatest impact on observed variation in survival for all of the species. Survival varied as a function of nitrogen deposition in 20 of the 50 species, and responses were stronger in saplings than in canopy trees. Despite clear sorting of the presence of the tree species along regional gradients of temperature and water deficit, there was only modest evidence that either sapling or canopy tree mortality varied systematically along those gradients. For 24 of the 50 species, the most parsimonious models did not include either temperature or water deficit variables. The exceptions to this were for several species of colder climates in which survival declined significantly in warmer climates. In 40 of the 50 species, there was no significant variation in survival as a function of either average growing season water deficit or the most extreme individual growing season water deficit during the 20 yr preceding the end of the census interval. The frequency of all but the most xeric of our study species declines at some point along a water deficit gradient. But it is seedling survival (reported in earlier work), rather than survival of saplings and canopy trees, that varies systematically along water deficit gradients.},

  abstract = {Environmental fluctuations are pervasive in nature, but the influence of nondirectional temporal variation on range limits has received scant attention. We synthesize insights from the literature and use simple models to make conceptual points about the potentially wide range of ecological and evolutionary effects of temporal variation on range limits. Because organisms respond nonlinearly to environmental conditions, temporal variation can directionally alter long-Term growth rates, either to shrink or to expand ranges. We illustrate this diversity of outcomes with a model of competition along a mortality gradient. Temporal variation can permit transitions between alternative states, potentially facilitating range expansion. We show this for variation in dispersal, using simple source sink population models (with strong Allee effects, or with gene flow hampering local adaptation). Temporal variation enhances extinction risk owing to demographic stochasticity, rare events, and loss of genetic variation, all tending to shrink ranges. However, specific adaptations to exploit variation (including dispersal) may permit larger ranges than in similar but constant environments. Grappling with temporal variation is essential both to understand eco-evolutionary dynamics at range limits and to guide conservation and management strategies.},

  abstract = {Drought-induced tree mortality is expected to increase worldwide under projected future climate changes. The Canadian boreal forests, which occupy about 30{\%} of the boreal forests worldwide and 77{\%} of Canada's total forested land, play a critical role in the albedo of Earth's surface and in its global carbon budget. Many of the previously reported regional-scale impacts of drought on tree mortality have affected low- and middle-latitude tropical regions and the temperate forests of the western United States, but no study has examined high-latitude boreal regions with multiple species at a regional scale using long-term forest permanent sampling plots. Here, we estimated tree mortality in natural stands throughout Canada's boreal forests using data from the permanent sampling plots and statistical models. We found that tree mortality rates increased by an overall average of 4.7{\%} yr−1 from 1963 to 2008, with higher mortality rate increases in western regions than in eastern regions (about 4.9 and 1.9{\%} yr−1, respectively). The water stress created by regional drought may be the dominant contributor to these widespread increases in tree mortality rates across tree species, sizes, elevations, longitudes and latitudes. Western Canada seems to have been more sensitive to drought than eastern Canada.},

  abstract = {A spatial and mechanistic model is developed for the dynamics of transition$\backslash$noak-northern hardwoods forests in northeastern North America. The$\backslash$npurpose of the model is to extrapolate from measurable fine-scale$\backslash$nand short-term interactions among individual trees to large-scale$\backslash$nand long-term dynamics of forest communities. Field methods, statistical$\backslash$nestimators, and model structure were designed simultaneously to ensure$\backslash$nthat parameters could be estimated from data collected in the field.$\backslash$nThis paper documents eight aspects of a three-year study to calibrate,$\backslash$ntest, and analyze the model for the nine dominant and subdominant$\backslash$ntree species in transition oak-northern hardwoods forests: 1) Design$\backslash$nand structure of the model. The model makes population dynamic forecasts$\backslash$nby predicting the fate of every individual tree throughout its life.$\backslash$nSpecies-specific functions predict each tree's dispersal, establishment,$\backslash$ngrowth, mortality, and fecundity. Trees occupy unique spatial positions,$\backslash$nand individual performance is affected by the local availability$\backslash$nof resources. Competition is mechanistic; resources available to$\backslash$neach tree are reduced by neighbors. Although the model was developed$\backslash$nto include light, water, and nitrogen, the version described here$\backslash$nincludes only competition for light (shading and light-dependent$\backslash$nperformance) because the field data provide little evidence of competition$\backslash$nfor nitrogen and water over the range of sites examined. 2) Estimates$\backslash$nof the model's parameters for each species. The estimates reveal$\backslash$na variety of {"}strategic trade-offs{"} among the species. For example,$\backslash$nspecies that grow quickly under high light tend to cast relatively$\backslash$nlittle shade, have low survivorship under low light, and have high$\backslash$ndispersal. In contrast, species that grow slowly under high light$\backslash$ntend to cast relatively dark shade, and to have high survivorship$\backslash$nunder low light and low dispersal. These trade-offs define one of$\backslash$ntwo dominant {"}axes{"} of strategic variation. 3) Community level predictions$\backslash$nof the model. The model predicts succession from early dominance$\backslash$nby species such as Quercus rubra and Prunus serotina, to late dominance$\backslash$nby Fagus grandifolia and Tsuga canadensis, with Betula alleganiensis$\backslash$npresent as a gap phase species in old-growth stands. The model also$\backslash$npredicts that old-growth communities will have intraspecifically$\backslash$nclumped and interspecifically segregated spatial distributions. 4)$\backslash$nAn error analysis that identifies community level predictions that$\backslash$nare robust given the level of sampling uncertainty in the study.$\backslash$nThis analysis translates the statistical uncertainty associated with$\backslash$neach parameter estimate into statistical uncertainty in the model's$\backslash$npredictions. The robust predictions include those mentioned in aspect$\backslash$n(3) above. 5) Sensitivity of the model to changes in initial conditions$\backslash$nand to changes in the three parameters not included in the error$\backslash$nanalysis. For example, the model predicts that initial abundances$\backslash$ncontinue to affect community composition well into succession ({\textgreater}$\backslash$n300 yr for some species). 6) Tests of the system- and community-level$\backslash$npredictions of the model against independent data gleaned from other$\backslash$nstudies. These tests support the predictions found to be robust in$\backslash$nthe error analysis, including those predictions mentioned in aspect$\backslash$n(3) above. 7) Modeling experiments that determine which aspects of$\backslash$nindividual performance and inter-neighbor competition are responsible$\backslash$nfor each of the robust predictions identified in aspect (4) above$\backslash$nand tested in aspect (6) above. This analysis reveals a wide variety$\backslash$nof causal relationships, with most parameters contributing to at$\backslash$nleast one community level phenomenon. 8) An explanation of the diversity$\backslash$nof individual level causes identified in aspect (7). The two {"}axes{"}$\backslash$ndescribing most of the strategic variation among the species (see$\backslash$n[2]), provide a simple explanation of community level pattern in$\backslash$nterms of individual level processes.},
