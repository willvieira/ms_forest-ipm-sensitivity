# Introduction

- It is important to undertand the mechanisms driven species distribution

- Climate and copetition are often assumed to be important drivers of species distribution

- In light of proposing a better model to predict and undertand species distribution, the demographic range model has been proposed as mechanistic approach grounded in ecological theory

- Many studies have tried to predict distribution from local models of performance, but they fail because the lack some important features

- This kind of model allows us to fully assess the sensitivity of population growth rate ($\lambda$) to climate and competition covariates, but it has rarely being done. Furhtermore, we don't know if sensitivity can change across the range of the species

- Here we build an IPM to accounting for the limitations of past models.
  - Mecanistic models based in ecological processes
  - Effect of climate and competition in all vital rates
  - Partition of competition into conspecific and heterospecific effect
  - While accounting for model uncertainty at different organizational scales

- Objective

# Methods

## Inventory and climate data

## Model

### Vital rate Intercepts

Growth, survival, and recruitment

### Covariates

Random effects, competition, climate

### Model fit and validation

### Integral Projection Model

## Perturbation analysis

# Results

## Model validation

- Intercept

- Covariates

## Sensitivity

- Overall sensitivity across species

- Sensitivity to climate and competition across the geographical position

- Difference in sensitivity to climate and competition between cold and hot border for each species

# Discussion

- Our model showed overall good fit for demographic rates across the 31 forest species. Overall, species are more sensitive to climate rather than competition across their range distribution. The sensitivity to climate and competition changed across the species range. Furthermore, sensitivity showed different patterns depending on the location position of the species across the temperature range. These results are important to undertand the future reponse to climate change, perturbation, and forest management.

- Discuss the higher sensitivity of $\lambda$ to climate compared to competition

- Discuss the ratio  
- 
- 
- why sensitivity to climate and competition is higher at the cold range compared to the hot range
