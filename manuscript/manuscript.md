# Introduction

The urge to unravel the processes driving the species distribution has increased with the current global crisis, where 15 to 37% of species are expected to go extinct due to climate change [@thomas2004].
This is especially important for long-lived sessile species, such as trees, whose range distribution is likely to fail to follow climate change [@Zhu2012;@Sittaro2017].
In ligth to improve the classic correlative species distribution models [e.g. @guissn2000], theory decomposes the observed distribution of species into small components to develop a more mechanistic, processed-based approach [@Evans2016].
One such approach is demographic range models that predict the distribution of a species as the manifestation of individual performance defined by growth, survival, and recruitment demographic rates [@Pagel2012].
It is based on the hypothesis that population growth rate ($\lambda$), determined by demographic rates, should vary across the environement; therefore the range limit of a species is set of conditions where $\lambda$ is non-negative [@maguire1973niche;@Holt2009].
By approaching species distribution from a demographic perspective we can to account for the complexity of forest dynamics arising from multiple features such as environemnt and species interaction [Schurr2012;@Svenning2014].

Many studies have tried to predict species distribution from demographic performance.
The most basic version of these models is to use environement dependent demographic rates to predict $\lambda$ [e.g. @Merow2014].
However, other factors such as species interaction undoubly affect demographic rates and the underlyning species distribution [Svenning2014].
Indeed, competition has been shown as a principal driver in the demographic rates [@@Luo2011;@Clark2011;@Zhang2015] and population performance [@Scherrer2020;@lesquin2021] of forest trees.
This realized version of the niche [@Hutchinson1957] can possible explain why north american forest trees are often not present at their climatic suitable range [@Boucher-Lalonde2012;@Talluto2017].

Regardless of thoretical predictions, there is a growing body evidence showing that the demographic performance of trees are weaky correlated with their large scale distribution [@McGill2012;@Thuiller2014;@Csergo2017;@bohner2020;@LeSquin2021;@Midolo2021;@Guyennon2023].
This mistmatch is often explained by the lack of consideration of processes beyond climate and competition.
For instance, habitat availability acompled with dispersal limitation can reduce the distribution of a species from locations in which performance is postive [@Pulliam2000].
However, the precision of the methods used to quantify demographic performance is rarely contested, in part peharps, because every attempt uses a different approach.
Some studies assess performance solely based on one of the growth, survival, and recruitment rates [@McGill2012;@bohner2020].
When the study intergrates demographic rates into population models, it often misses some components such as the recruitment part [@Midolo2021;@LeSquin2021].
Furthermore, some studies do not account for density-dependence [@Csergo2017;@Ohse2023], and when they do, it is rarely the case of accounting for the difference between conspecific and heterospecific competition [@bohner2020;LeSquin2021; but see @Guyennon2023].

Then, instead of asking whether demographic rates is correlated to distribution, we should perhaps ask how is climate and competition actually affecting demographic performance.
Indeed, we still miss a comprenshive understanding of the sensitivity of forest dynamics to its drivers [@Ohse2023].
For instance, @Clark2011 found that individual growth is more sensitive to competition, while fecundity is more sensitivity to climate.
In contrast, @CopenhaverParry2016 found that growth was more sensitive to climate rather than competition.
Although these studies provide important insides on demographic models' sensitivity, they only assess single demographic models and lack the complete picture of the population dynamic.
Furhtermore, we have little information on how the relative importance of climate and competition changes across the range distribution of a species [@Louthan2015].

Here, we evaluate how climate and competition affect the demography and population growth rate of the 31 most abundant forest tree species across Eastern North America.
We leverage the complete (26 - 53Â°) latitudinal coverage of forest inventories across the US and Canada to capture the biogeographical range distribution of these species.
Specifically, we model each of the growth, survival, and recruitment vital rates as a function of mean annual temperature and precipitation, as well as a function of conspecific and heterospecific basal area density as a proxy for competition for light.
We use non-linear hierarchical Bayesian models that are flexible to capture the multiple effect forms that each climate and competition covariate can have in the demographic models.
We then incorporate the growth, survival, and recruitment models into an Integral Projection Model (IPM) to quantify the $\lambda$ of each species under climate and competition effects.

Our main goal was to use the IPM to compute the sensitivity of each species $\lambda$ to climate and competition across the range distribution.
Specifically, we use perturbation analysis to quantify the relative contribution of each covariate to changes in population growth rate [@Caswell2001].

# Discussion

- Our model showed overall good fit for demographic rates across the 31 forest species. Overall, species are more sensitive to climate rather than competition across their range distribution. The sensitivity to climate and competition changed across the species range. Furthermore, sensitivity showed different patterns depending on the location position of the species across the temperature range. These results are important to undertand the future reponse to climate change, perturbation, and forest management.
